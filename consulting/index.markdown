			<p class="lead">Mobile apps are more than just a fad. Poeple are more connected than ever. Smartphones are practically ubiquitous and we can help you leverage their power. I love the Microsoft development stack and Windows Phone is no exception. However, the iPhone and Android crowd are not out of luck. Options such as Mono (by Xamarin) or responsive Web Design are different ways every mobile platform can benefit!</p>

Databases design and database administration are still crucial pieces to the majority of software solutions.
