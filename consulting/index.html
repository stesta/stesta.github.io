Consulting Services  
-------------------
In addition to the catalog of products, I am also available for contract in regards to a consulting engagement. Testa Software can provide brand new solutions or consult on an existing systems. What follows is a summary of some of the services offered. This services list is by no means absolute, please contact me to discuss the full range of services or browse the provided mind map (download here) for the full range of technologies and frameworks I am more than profiecient in.   

### Web Development and Design  
The speciality here at Testa Software is web development and design. I can handle everything from static websites up to enterprise grade web applications. I am versed in serveral different technologies including: HTML5, Advanced CSS3, Less, C#/.Net, Javascript/Node and PHP.   

Content management systems are a must if updating your own content is a concern. Systems like Orchard CMS (my personal favorite), Umbraco and DotNetNuke can all be implemented and built upon to deliver a solution that tailored to general or very custom needs.  

Need to make sure a website is has the visibility it needs in the search rankings? That's where SEO (Search Engine Optimization) comes in. As a long time web professional, I can help guide you and/or you company through better SEO practices.  

### Hosting and Domains  
Once a website is developed it will need a place to be hosted. Whether you want to host with me or just need a little help finding and setting up your own host Testa Software can provide a solution. Confused about cloud services like Windows Azure or Amazon's EC2? Maybe DNS is causing problems? Perhaps you need some education on how to administrate your own server? We have the knowledge!   

### Windows Applications  
Web sites and web applications have come a long way and everyone needs one, but what if you have specific need for a desktop application? How about a new Modern UI application for the Windows 8 platform? Well you'll be glad to know there are service options available!  

### Mobile Development  
Mobile apps are more than just a fad. Poeple are more connected than ever. Smartphones are practically ubiquitous and we can help you leverage their power. I love the Microsoft development stack and Windows Phone is no exception. However, the iPhone and Android crowd are not out of luck. Options such as Mono (by Xamarin) or responsive Web Design are different ways every mobile platform can benefit!   

### Database Services  
Just because mobile is the upcoming technology doesn't mean you should neglect your tried and true technologies. Databases design and database administration are still crucial pieces to the majority of software solutions. If care isn't taken to follow best practices, a poor database implementation can easily become downfall of a project.
