There are two types of developers: those who are supposed to be developers and those who are not. The key distiction is passion.<!--more--> Passion means peeling back the layers and taking a peek under the hood. It's about really knowing how software works and loving every bit (pun intended) from the elegant to the mudane. 

One layer I highly recommend every .Net developer take a peek as is IL. IL (Intermediate Language) is the language inbetween. Understand IL provides a number of benefits that all stem from a deeper understanding of how the .Net Framework actually works. 

 - Expand your knowledge
 - Performance tweaking
 - Deeper understand that aids in debugging

Tools required:  
If you have Visual Studio installed then you already have the majority of the tools necessary to get started. To start 
   - Notepad (wait didn't you just Visual Studio?)
   - Developer Command Prompt
   - CSC
   - ILDASM
   - ILASM
 - ILSpy

Decompiling IL
