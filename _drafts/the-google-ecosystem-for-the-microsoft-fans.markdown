I love my Nexus 7. I border on Microsoft fanboy, but I purchased my Android device to branch out development to other platforms. I wanted to reach an additional audience. However, because the tablet  
was a new and shiney toy I started carrying it around. The form factor is great. It's a 7" tablet that fits in my back pocket and really balances being ultra portable, functional and not being 
too small and cumbersome - which my phone can be sometimes.  

That said, the Microsoft ecosystem has a very attractive story these days. Things like OneDrive, OneNote, Office365, XBox and even Visual Studio are all things I use on a daily basis. These 
are all programs and experiences I want to carry over with me across platforms. Don't misunderstand. I'm not trying to start up a Windows vs. Google war. I don't believe that either of these 
two platforms are actually better or worse than the other. They both have their pros and cons. I'm merely saying that while I have a google account I'm already invested heavily in the Microsoft 
ecosystem. 

I'll start by putting on my consumer hat and share some of the apps I've found helpful in my experiences on the Android platform.

#### Apps  

**Outlook.com**  
This was a big one. I carry a Windows Phone as my daily driver. All of my contacts, calendar and emails are connected to my Microsoft account. My Nexus has KitKat (Android v4.4) installed on it 
and Windows Live is no longer a valid account type that can be added to the device. Outlook.com fixes the issue, but it is a bit difficult to find because Microsoft is not listed as the 
developer. As soon as the outlook.com app is installed contacts, calendar and email are all magically available. 

**OneDrive**  
Microsoft's OneDrive is my primary cloud storage location for both my desktop and phone. All of my important files and pictures are there. Having them accessible from my Nexus 7 is huge. 
As a bonus I was even able to turn on automatic camera backup during application setup. 

**OneNote**  
Again, I use OneDrive for almost everything so OneNote is a natural place for me to jot things down. 

**Xbox Smartglass**  
I love my Xbox. Smartglass is a cool companion app available on every major tablet platform and Android is no exception

**Xbox Music**  
I got into Xbox Music because of my phone. I realize there are plenty of other good options, but this is where I landed with my music service. It was a pleasant surprise to find the 
Android app was available.

**Skype**  
So Skype is really more of a Microsoft aquisition, but I've been using Skype forever. It's comforting to know there is a big company like Microsoft behind it these days to continue to push 
the product forward. Especially considering today's Microsoft seems to be pushing toward services. I have faith they'll keep the product alive and well across all the different platforms.

**Bing**  
OK, admittedly Bing is a tough sell here. Google's search engine is truly unbeatable and it's so deeply integrated into the device. But let's be honest... I need my Bing rewards points. I'll 
use the app until I've hit my limit or can't find what I want.

Finally, I'd like to talk a bit about my experiences with my developer hat on. I'm going to avoid the cloud services debate and just dive into my experiences with the Android development 
process.

#### Development  

**Visual Studio and Mono for Android**  
You can argue all you want against Visual Studio, but you'd be wrong. Visual Studio is the premier IDE for developers. Java and iOS folks can rant and rave all they want about eclipse and XCode, but at the end of the day they lose. 

**Android Studio**  
The argument against using Visual Studio (and it's a valid argument) is that you're not really thinking or developing like an Android Developer. For that reason I would say that even as a Microsoft fan, sometimes we just need
