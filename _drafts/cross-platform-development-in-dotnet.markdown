The Problem
-----------

As developers and software architects, the onus is on us code and deliver solutions. One problem is that, in this day and <!--more-->age, *cross-platform* solutions are key to success. 
We live in an exciting time full of a wide variety of computers, devices and gadgets. Think about that for a second. I don't know many people who don't carry a smartphone 
and everyone has picked a side in the mobile holy war. iPhone. Android. Windows Phone. Responsive Websites. Besides mobile, the desktop/laptop choices have diverse following. 
Microsoft. Apple. Linux. The fanboy and fangirl-ism gets even worse when it comes to gaming. XBox versus Playstation. Console versus. PC. To top it all off think of all the 
different screen sizes, form factors, tablets, phablets, watches, etc... it's a lot.

What are we, as developers, supposed to do about all the ways the modern user accesses content and applications? With all the different platforms come different programming 
languages and frameworks. If you've been a developer for any significant amount of time you know that there's no way to possibly learn it all. You can try, but you'll get burnt 
out quickly. Even worse, generally a jack of all trades is an expert in none. There is a solution to this problem. 

> The answer is to niche down. 

What does niche down mean? It could mean making a decision to stick to a single platform. For instance, choosing to be an Android developer over iPhone. Or deciding to write 
your indie game exclusively for the XBox. However, I would contend that niching down can also refer to making the decision to stick to a single programming framework. 
If you've read the blog post title, you already know I advocate .Net! How is .Net cross-platform you ask? Good question, let's dig into that.
