When it comes to development and software, I'm a big proponent of peeling back the layers. In an effort to take this concept to the extreme I picked up a book call Elements of Computing Systems. The idea behind the book is that it takes you on a step by step journey through *a computing system*. The book starts at that line between electrical engineering and computer science (the Nand gate) and proceeds to build more complex chipsets; on top of that, assembly; and on top of that, a high level programming language. The end result is that you are able to write a computer in code that will execute and run code written in the high level language you have built. The practical upshot to this sort of knowledge would be an understand of how to create an emulator. The book itself is all Java based, but I chose to use JavaScript.
