<p>I woke up and received a pleasant surprise this morning. I plugged my phone in and was prompted to update my phone. Three updates came across the wire: 8112, 8773 (Tango) and a Nokia firmware update. I caught an article breaking <a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/tango-uk-nokia-lumia-800-update-spotted">the story on WPCentral</a> with the only difference here being that I'm a US customer. My phone is still an unlocked Lumia 800 though.</p>
<p>You can find a list of the pertinent updates all over the web, but personally I'm glad to have the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/1/2990739/nokia-lumia-800-volume-fix-update">Lumia 800 volume issues fixed</a> (the update hadn't ever come across for me).</p>
