<p>If you're not familiar with column select you're missing out on a ton of multiline editing goodness. Just hold down the alt key while you're selecting items with your mouse and you'll see what I mean.</p>

<!--more-->

<pre>alt+left mouse</pre>
<p>You can edit columns&nbsp;of information at once with out having to&nbsp;retype or paste in information over and over.&nbsp;Column select is a little difficult to explain so I created a quick screen capture to show off the awesomeness of this feature.</p>
<p>Again, all that going on here is a selection using the alt key plus the right mouse button. Then you just type away.</p>
