Hello, Everyone!  

Like so many other bloggers before me, I have decided to start a sub-genre of posts that focus on the cool and interesting things 
I come across in my daily adventures on the interwebs. Keeping with blogging/internet tradition, these posts will pretty much happen 
randomly whenever I get around to them.  

So... Welcome to Internet Snippets and the inaugural post the January 2014 Edition!  

- Let's start this off with one of my absolute favorite sites, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Projct Euler</a> (pronounced: "oiler"). It is a series of progressively challenging math problems that are sure to be enjoyed by nerds everywhere!</li>
- A interesting article by Will Warner on <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/will-warner/2014/01/21/courage-vs-cargo-cults.html">integrity and software craftsmanship</a>.</li>
- You can learn to code the easy way or you can <a href="http://learncodethehardway.org/">learn to code the hard way</a>.</li>

- As web developers there is often the need for image place holders. Why not have some fun with that? Maybe <a href="http://www.placecage.com/">Nick Cage</a>? Or <a href="http://www.fillmurray.com/">Bill Murray</a>? Or perhaps <a href="http://placezombies.com/">zombies</a>?</li>
