<p>We are, undoubtedly, in a programming age of innovation! Every day there are new libraries and new frameworks to learn and keep up on. This is a stark contrast to the old days (think the dot com era) when everything was a static web page and there was almost zero innovation. The unfortunate consequence of this constant innovation is that we often forget about the knowledge and tools of computing past. Innovation doesn't necessarily render that knowledge useless and it is all too easy to forget. Occassionally we need to remind ourselves of how things used to get done.</p>
<p><strong>app_offline.htm</strong></p>
<p>This is one of my favorites because it's often overlooked and used infrequently enough (hopefully) that it's easily missed. If you're doing any sort of web programming using IIS this guy can be your best friend. There will come a time when you need to take down your production site. It is going to happen. Maybe you need to make an upgrade to your core platform? Or maybe today just isn't your day there are too many issues to keep the site up and running?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>xcopy</strong></p>
<p>It's amazing to me how undervalued this utility is. The xcopy command has been around since DOS and it continues to provide value. I've watched some of the younger generation try and write the complicated file syncing utilities in power shell when it could all be handled with a single xcopy command. Not that there's anything wrong with power shell, but a lot of the time it feels like some folks just want to duplicate effort. There's no reason to do it the hard way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what other "oldies but goodies" are often forgotten about?</p>
