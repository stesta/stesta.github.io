The doomsday preppers, survival enthusiasts and fans of Bear Grills may be familiar with the term Everyday Carry - EDC to those in the know. Everyday carry is basically 
a small set of items and tools picked to help tackle any situations that may occur. Common tool choices include: pocket knives, mini-flashlights, paracord, wrist-watches, etc.

To quote wikipedia...

As developers we can follow that same spirit of preparedness. Admittedly, our "situations" are less about survival and more about fixing the computer issues for almost everyone 
we know. Thanks to portable apps we can carry our tools with us via usb drive or virtually via cloud storage.

**Sublime Text**

**Procmon**  

**FileZilla**  


So that's my list. You can probably tell I'm mostly a .Net developer, however, EDC is about choosing and tailoring the tools you carry to your own personal needs. I encourage 
you to build your own list of tools and start carrying them with you if you don't already.
