The doomsday preppers, survival enthusiasts and fans of Bear Grills may be familiar with the term Everyday Carry - EDC to those in the know. Everyday carry is basically 
a small set of items and tools picked to help tackle any situations that may occur. Common tool choices include: pocket knives, mini-flashlights, paracord, wrist-watches, etc.

To quote wikipedia...

As developers we can follow that same spirit of preparedness. Admittedly, our "situations" are less about survival and more about fixing the computer issues for almost everyone 
we know. Thanks to portable apps we can carry our tools with us via usb drive or virtually via cloud storage.  

**LinqPad**  
LinqPad is indispensable. As a .Net developer this is a utility I have open daily. It's great for database queries via linq or just to write some quick code or utilities. 

The developer of LinqPad is Joseph Albahari and seriously you need to support this dude. Don't even think about and pony up the $75 for a premium license ($58 through the end of this month!). This program more than pays for itself in terms of you productivity gains. You can [grab the standalone executable](http://www.linqpad.net/) right from the homepage!

**Sublime Text**  
This is an all around awesome editor. Sublime Text completely blew me away: great syntax highlighting, awesome plugin community, column select and a vi mode to top it all off! Grab the [portable version here](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) and try it for yourself. You won't be disappointed!

**Procmon**  
[SysInternals](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062). 'Nuff said. The built in Windows Task Manager and Resource Manager are great. Procmon is better.

**FileZilla**  
The majority of websites I work on personally usually don't require FTP. When it comes to family and friends, however, crappy webhosts mean FTP is the best option. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1) has been around a long time and still holds up.

So there are a few short items that make up some my list. They help me get by when I don't have my computer with me. You can probably tell I'm mostly a .Net developer, however, EDC is about choosing and tailoring the tools you carry to your own personal needs. I encourage 
you to build your own list of tools and start carrying them with you if you don't already.  

Share your own EDC tool list in the comments!
