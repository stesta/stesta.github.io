Some more wonderful links to check out. Games, announcements, knowledge...  
- An awesome <a href="http://crosscuttingconcerns.com/tag/LetsBuildAnAspect">blog post series</a> by Matthew D. Groves on how to build an aspect. Well worth your time.  
- Visual Studio Online just introduced some <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/integrate/explore/explore-vso-vsi">new integration APIs</a>.  
- A new game&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/glorious-leader-kim-jong-un-star-his-own-video-game-n106031">Glorious Leader</a>. I'm leaning towards this is hilarious!  
- Another game (more serious this time), <a href="http://superhotgame.com/play-prototype">Superhot</a>. It's just a prototype, but a cool concept.  
- Just Announced: <a href="http://blog.surface.com/2014/05/announcing-surface-pro-3/">Surface Pro 3</a>... need!
