Some more wonderful links to check out. Games, announcements, knowledge...   
- An awesome [blog post series](http://crosscuttingconcerns.com/tag/LetsBuildAnAspect) by Matthew D. Groves on how to build an aspect. Well worth your time.  
- Visual Studio Online just introduced some [new integration APIs](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/integrate/explore/explore-vso-vsi).  
- A new game [Glorious Leader](http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/glorious-leader-kim-jong-un-star-his-own-video-game-n106031). I'm leaning towards this is hilarious!  
- Another game (more serious this time), [Superhot](http://superhotgame.com/play-prototype). It's just a prototype, but a cool concept.  
- Just Announced: [Surface Pro 3](http://blog.surface.com/2014/05/announcing-surface-pro-3/)... need!
